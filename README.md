# AWS Terraform Starter

This repository contains documents and scripts that can be used as a base or template for AWS-based Terraform repositories.

There are three main directories:

* `docs` contains documentation on how to use the included scripts
* `terraform` contains some sample Terraform configuration
* `tools` contains scripts to prepare an AWS account for use with Terraform and build AWS infrastructure with Terraform (both Bash and PowerShell scripts)

To get started, fork this repository or copy its contents then change anything you like! In particular, make sure you go through each file in `terraform` and `tools` and change instances of `username` to whatever username you choose when following the getting started guide.
